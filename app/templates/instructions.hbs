<h4>The Selective Society of Self-Imposed Secret Stalkers is comprised of real people, in real time, out in the real world.</h4>
<p>Your goal is obvious: hunt down and find your targets (other members in your vicinity) before you yourself are found. You'll be given up to 3 targets, while up to 3 members will be hunting you.</p>
<p>Members can view their targets' recent location on a map. Members accrue stealth points every minute they have the app open, which updates their location. Stealth points are used to purchase aids and enhancements (coming soon).</p>
<p> Your defense, besides being sneaky, is to attempt to expose your hunters: at any time, you can view the other members and guess which of them are your hunters. If you are right, they'll be removed and your status will increase. If you're wrong, <span class="italic">you'll</span> be removed.</p>
